# function

Welcome to the repository of function(), my blog (accessible at https://blog.arashnrim.me)! function() primarily focuses on sharing code snippets I find useful, experiences that I have gone through, and stories that I wish to share with the world.

The source code features the following tech stack:

|                        Technology                        | Description of use                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|              [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)               | The framework used to power the entire website. Part of the Jamstack architecture, it allows me to easily build the website.                                                 |
|         [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)          | The CSS framework used to style the website. It allows me to easily style the website while keeping the design standardised.                                                 |
|               [Vercel](https://vercel.com)               | The platform used to deploy the website. It allows me to effortlessly publish live changes to the domain at a single push.                                                   |
| [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) | The Markdown-to-HTML parser used to read MDX content and turn it into plain HTML. It allows me to display my posts in Markdown in a way that React (via Next.js) can render. |

## Motivations

For a while, I have visited the blogs of a few developers who shared interesting solutions to the problems they've faced that I had as well. I was impressed with how each blog was unique to its own self and the developer itself: content-wise, design-wise, and style-wise. In a way, blogs can be used to share more about an individual — not just a developer — through the way they write, design, and plan.

That inspired me to create a blog of my own. Not to mention, embarking on a project like this allowed me to expand my horizons with what I know and learn new things while enjoying the process of learning by doing.
