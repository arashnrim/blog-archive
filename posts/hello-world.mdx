Hello, world!

This attempt at starting a blog of my own certainly isn't one of my first. If you tried looking hard enough on the Internet, you'd find many different blogs I created in the past on a wide array of platforms. I had little intention and direction for where I wanted to head with my blog back then.

Now, though, slowly gaining skills as a developer, I'm more inclined to have a reason to have a blog. To me, it's a wonderful opportunity to share more about my experience about anything. For starters, it may be just for myself — a little repository of tips and helpful messages to pass down to me. But, in the future, perhaps my blog may reach others too. For what it's worth, I hope that this blog will be beneficial one way or another to me and the visitors that come by. (If you're reading this and aren't me, thanks for stopping by!)

# Structure

Just to have a solid foundation on where I'm headed with this blog, I'd like to set a few categories of posts that I can make. At the top of my head as of writing, these categories include:

- learning logs — documenting what I have tried, the reasons for doing what I did, and resources I've referred to while learning. In a way, it's learning in public — a concept I came across recently and came to be fond of;
- experiences — sharing my experience going through or doing certain things, like a particular event or even trying out a new platform or app; and
- code snippets and valuable resources — passing the baton of useful articles, Stack Overflow posts, and more.

Of course, this list isn't exhaustive, and I may wish to add more categories if they're appropriate for my blog. I hope you'll enjoy reading each post the way they are, nonetheless!

# This blog

This blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com). The design was intentionally made to replicate the design system from my website, so it wasn't too difficult trying to port over a design system previously built the same way over to this project.

I intend to write another article going through the nitty-gritty of how this blog was made in the form of a learning log. If you're interested in that, come by and check again soon!

# Thank you!

Thanks for stopping by this blog! This blog is in its early stages, but I hope to continue writing more and refining the blog as I go on. It's definitely more convenient that the source code was written by me!

Here's to more blog posts. Thank you once again for stopping by, and come again soon!
