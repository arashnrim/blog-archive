# function()

## Introduction

Welcome to the project repository of my blog, function()! This project was built from the ground up with the help of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler), and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

Works are still being done actively in the background to make it better, and it's currently at an early stage (meaning that more features can still be implemented soon!). Should you notice some minor discrepancies like minor bugs and issues, please feel free to create an Issue.

## Contributing

Since this project is mostly a personal project, it is unlikely that external assistance is required for this project. Either way, though, if you would like to offer some assistance — offering tips, for example — the Issues page is always open.

## Licence

The [MIT Licence](https://github.com/arashnrim/function/blob/main/LICENSE) has been employed for this project, so please adhere to its requirements appropriately. If you are making a fork or cloning this repository, I hope it doesn't bother you to remove the `posts/` directory — the contents of that folder should rightfully belong to me.
